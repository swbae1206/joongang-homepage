              <p>The CA-wire part has been improved, with its high removal rate of water from stock fiber under low vacuum rate, compared to the conventional wire system. This system has been designed and manufactured to increase manufacturing speed, facilitate the uniform distribution of fiber stock, increase quality in sheet roughness and improve air resistance and high strength against break, thus giving customers high productivity and good quality paper products at a reasonal cost. The conventional wire system had disadvantages such as a high danger of sheet breakage when the drainage of water and air simulataneously from the mixed stock is implemented. This system has improved that feature of conventional system and also has a capacity of operation under high speed, able to cater to the demands of customers..</p>

It is also uses the V belt, which is positioned between the soft parts of fabrics. The fiber is pressured between the fabric and plastic wire and drained by the remaining vacuum in the cylinder mold and tension in fabric so that certain water content and a certain width of
fiber can be kept. It also help the pressing roll uniformly transfer water through every part. This is transferred to fabrics by a vacuum box, eventually moving to nest the ultra former.</p>

              <p>Our press machine raises the water removal rate by 10-25% relative to conventional machines using the increased pressure of wide rolls. It also increases sheet strength and productivity, and minimizes the difference between inside and outside pressure by bi-directional water removal and packing effect. By adding a 3rd press, it is possible to minimize the requirements of surface treatment, raise tension strength and lower the cost by reducing the amount of evaporation by 15-20% without any reduction in paper quality. It is also designed to exchange rolls easily , thus making it easy to operate and maintain.

Even during high-speed operation, this machine keeps water removal even and uniform. By removing water content by as much as 10-25% more than the conventional machine, it can produce good quality paper with a higher drying rate by 5-7% relative to that of conventional machines, and excellent roll pressure. Additionally, this machine is designed to change and maintain fabrics easily so that the life of fabrics can be extended even in high-speed operations.</p>
